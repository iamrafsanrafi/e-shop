### Project Description
'e-shop' is a modern, high-performing e-commerce website. Specially built with React, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS. I engineered a visually appealing, seamless shopping system with a mobile-first approach.

Some key features are searching, filtering, sorting, pagination, user cart management with Redux, and secure checkout (Stripe) using a lightweight Express backend. It also supports user authentication via Google and email/password with Firebase.

I implemented best practices such as React hooks, image compression, lazy loading, and loading UIs to ensure high performance and interactivity.
